          Feature requests may be considered as long as they align with the
          purpose of this browser extension and can be accomplished with CSS and
          JavaScript (no external libraries). The basic version will only
          include features that do not change data in Canvas. Be sure to include
          a link to the Idea in the Canvas Community that aligns with the
          requested feature. The hope is for features included in this browser
          extension to eventually become a part of the Canvas LMS.
