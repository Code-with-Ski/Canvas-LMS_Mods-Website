            </p>
          </div>
        </details>

              This adds a simple search functionality to a course. The link to
              activate it is found on the course navigation menu. The search
              will look for case insensitve matches to the given search value.
              It currently searches assignment names/descriptions, discussion
              board titles/topics, announcement titles/topics, and page
              titles/content.
            </p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>

        <details>
          <summary>Add course statistics button</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature adds a button to the course home page that will link
              to the course statistics page. Since the custom course reports are
              added on this page, it will help to make them more easily
              accessible.

            <p>
              This feature adds a list of links to each of the modules before
              the first module. This also adds a back to top link under each
              module. This will help with quicker navigation to the module that
              a user wants to get to, especially when there is a long list of
              module content.
            </p>

              list of People. When enabled, it will default to have inactive
              users hidden. You can click the checkbox to make it so inactive

              <em>Uses the Canvas LMS REST API to provide this feature.</em>
            </p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Add export grades button to assignment page</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature adds button(s) on the assignment page to export
              grades. By default it will add the button "Export Grades" if it
              sees the ratio of graded assignment submissions on the right-hand
              side. By clicking this button, it will get the submissions for the
              assignments and export the data in a CSV file. It will include
              rubric scores too, if available. All data for a single submission
              will be on one row.
            </p>
            <p>
              If it also sees a rubric on the assignment page, it will add a
              second button to "Export Grades by Criteria". This will also get
              all the submissions for the assignment. However, now each row will
              include the submission details and one of the criteria details at
              a time. This will result in repeated submission details data, but
              avoids the need to keep scrolling to the right to view all of the
              criteria details.

              This feature adds an indicator to let the instructor know if the
              associated rubric is set to use for grading or not. If changes are
              made the indicator will update to let the user know to refresh the
              page to update the indicator.

        <p>
          The following features are mods that apply to a Rubrics page in a
          course.
        </p>

        <details>
          <summary>Add a search feature</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature adds a search bar to the rubrics page. This will make
              it easier to find rubrics when there is a long list.
            </p>
          </div>

        <details>
          <summary>Add a load details button</summary>
          <div>
            <p>

              to help with quick audits of the settings.
            </p>

          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Add drag-and-drop criteria rows feature</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature allows the user to drag and drop rubric rows when a
              rubric is in an editing state. If you drag a row up from its
              current position, it will push the row it is dropped on down. If
              you drag a row down from its current position, it will push the
              row it is dropped on up.
            </p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Add import rubric criteria feature</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature allows a user to import the rubric details when
              adding/editing a rubric. The user will need to follow the proper
              format and can use the sample file as a reference point. They will
              need to enter/paste the data in the import dialog with the column
              values separated by a tab. When the data is formatted properly it
              will load the details into the edit rubric preview. This allows
              the user to review the imported data and how it was added to the
              rubric before creating the rubric. This also allows the user to
              add additional criteria and/or import outcomes.
            </p>

            <p>There are two import options:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Import: This will keep any exisiting criteria in the rubric and
                add new rows to the end for the new criteria that are imported.
              </li>
              <li>
                Import and Replace: This will remove any existing criteria from
                the rubric and add rows for the new criteria that are imported.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This feature also adds an export criteria button next to the
              "Import Details" button. This will allow the user to export the
              current criteria in the edit view to a tab separated values file
              that is in the proper format for importing data. This is useful if
              a user has a rubric started already and is looking to add more
              criteria and wants to organize the rubric order all at once,
              especially when working with outcomes. It can also be used to
              allow the user to get the data from one rubric to use as a
              starting template for a new rubric and/or to 'make a copy'.

              This feature loads in a series of custom reports on the course
              sections page. This will help with pulling data about the section
              for review. The data can be viewed in the results table for each
              report and/or downloaded to CSV so the user can manipulate/use the
              data further in another application/script.
