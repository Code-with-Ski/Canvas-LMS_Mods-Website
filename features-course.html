      <section>
        <h3 id="global-course">Global Course Mods</h3>

        <p>
          The following features are mods that apply to most/all areas of a
          course.
        </p>

        <details>
          <summary>Enable sticky course header</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This makes it so the course header remains sticky at the top. This
              is to help make it easy to know what course you are in even when
              scrolling down the page.
            </p>
            <img
              class="screenshot"
              alt="Showing sticky header when scrolled down on the modules page"
              src="images/feature-screenshots/sticky-header-on-modules-example.png"
            />
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Enable course simple search</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This adds a simple search functionality to a course. The link to
              activate it is found on the course navigation menu. The search
              will look for case insensitve matches to the given search value.
              The search results will highlight the matching search term/phrase.
            </p>
            <p>
              It currently supports searching the following content areas (if
              selected): syllabus body, pages (title and body), assignments
              (title and body), discussion topics (title and body), announcement
              topics (title and body), file names, and module item names. The
              Canvas API is used to get the selected items and checck if the
              search value appears within them. Only data that the user has
              permission to view will show in the results.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Uses the Canvas LMS REST API to provide this feature.</em>
            </p>
            <img
              class="screenshot"
              alt="Simple search modal when it is opened initially"
              src="images/feature-screenshots/course-simple-search-initial-open.png"
            />
            <img
              class="screenshot"
              alt="Example simple search results"
              src="images/feature-screenshots/course-simple-search-results.png"
            />
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Simple search course navigation position</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This setting controls where the link to activate the simple search
              will be placed in the course navigation. The default position is
              set to '2' so that it will be placed after 'Home' on the course
              navigation menu. To adjust the position, go to the browser
              extension options and update this value.
            </p>
            <img
              class="screenshot"
              alt="Simple search button on the course navigation menu under the 'Home' link"
              src="images/feature-screenshots/simple-search-in-position-2.png"
            />
          </div>
        </details>
      </section>

      <!-- Course Home Page -->
      <section>
        <h3 id="home">Course Home Page</h3>

        <p>
          The following features are mods that apply to the home page in a
          course.
        </p>

        <details>
          <summary>Add course statistics button</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature adds a button to the course home page that will link
              to the course statistics page. Since the custom course reports are
              added on this page, it will help to make them more easily
              accessible.
            </p>
            <img
              class="screenshot"
              alt="Course home page with Statistics button in right-side navigation"
              src="images/feature-screenshots/course-home-statistics-button.png"
            />
          </div>
        </details>
      </section>

      <!-- Modules -->
      <section>
        <h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>

        <p>
          The following features are mods that apply to the Module page in a
          course.
        </p>

        <details>
          <summary>Add "Jump to Module" feature</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature adds a list of links to each of the modules before
              the first module. This also adds a back to top link under each
              module. This will help with quicker navigation to the module that
              a user wants to get to, especially when there is a long list of
              module content.
            </p>
            <img
              class="screenshot"
              alt="Course modules page with jump to module dialog and back to top button"
              src="images/feature-screenshots/course-modules-jump-to-module.png"
            />
          </div>
        </details>
      </section>

      <!-- People/Users -->
      <section>
        <h3 id="people">People/Users</h3>

        <p>
          The following features are mods that apply to the People/Users page in
          a course.
        </p>

        <details>
          <summary>Add export users button</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature will add a button to allow an instructor/admin to
              export the list of users. This will only export the users that are
              currently loaded on the People page. For courses with larger
              enrollments, be sure all People are loaded into the table before
              clicking the export button.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Uses the Canvas LMS REST API to provide this feature.</em>
            </p>
            <p>

          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Add hide inactive users feature</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature allows inactive users to be hidden from view in the
              list of People. When enabled, it will default to have inactive
              users hidden. You can click the checkbox to make it so inactive
              users are visible again when needed.
            </p>

          <div>
            <p>
              This feature adds an export button to the group set panels. This
              will make it easier for users to review group memberships in bulk
              and it provides the data that is in the format compatible with the
              import feature.

              This feature adds an expand all/collapse all groups button on each
              group set. When it shows "Expand All", it will expand all
              currently collapsed groups when clicked. When it shows "Collapse

            <p>
              The feature will allow a user to load in additional details about
              assignments that are useful for a quick audit of assignment
              settings. This includes the submission types, if it affects the
              final grade, and if it has an associated rubric. If it has an
              associated rubric, it also checks if it is used for grading and if
              any of the criteria are outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is an additional option to include a check for Turnitin
              being enabled for an assignment.

              assignment groups when clicked. When showing "Collapse All", it

          <summary>Add export grades button to assignment page</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature adds button(s) on the assignment page to export
              grades. By default it will add the button "Export Grades" if it
              sees the ratio of graded assignment submissions on the right-hand
              side. By clicking this button, it will get the submissions for the
              assignments and export the data in a CSV file. It will include
              rubric scores too, if available. All data for a single submission
              will be on one row.
            </p>
            <p>
              If it also sees a rubric on the assignment page, it will add a
              second button to "Export Grades by Criteria". This will also get
              all the submissions for the assignment. However, now each row will
              include the submission details and one of the criteria details at
              a time. This will result in repeated submission details data, but
              avoids the need to keep scrolling to the right to view all of the
              criteria details.

              This feature adds an indicator to let the instructor know if the
              associated rubric is set to use for grading or not. If changes are
              made the indicator will update to let the user know to refresh the
              page to update the indicator.

              This feature adds the ability to export grades for a discussion
              board. By default it will add the button "Export Grades" if it is
              an assignment. By clicking this button, it will get the
              submissions and export the data in a CSV file. It will include
              rubric scores too, if available. All data for a single submission

              If the discussion is an assignment with a rubric, it will add a
              second button to "Export Grades by Criteria". This will also get
              all the submissions. However, now each row will include the
              submission details and one of the rubric criteria details at a

              rubric is in an editing state. If you drag a row up from its
              current position, it will push the row it is dropped on down. If
              you drag a row down from its current position, it will push the
              row it is dropped on up.
            </p>
            <p>This is designed for the classic course rubric edit page.</p>

          <summary>Add import rubric criteria feature</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature allows a user to import the rubric details when
              adding/editing a rubric. The user will need to follow the proper
              format and can use the sample file as a reference point. They will
              need to enter/paste the data in the import dialog with the column
              values separated by a tab. When the data is formatted properly it
              will load the details into the edit rubric preview. This allows
              the user to review the imported data and how it was added to the
              rubric before creating the rubric. This also allows the user to
              add additional criteria and/or import outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>There are two import options:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Import: This will keep any exisiting criteria in the rubric and
                add new rows to the end for the new criteria that are imported.
              </li>
              <li>
                Import and Replace: This will remove any existing criteria from
                the rubric and add rows for the new criteria that are imported.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This feature also adds an export criteria button next to the
              "Import Details" button. This will allow the user to export the
              current criteria in the edit view to a tab separated values file
              that is in the proper format for importing data. This is useful if
              a user has a rubric started already and is looking to add more
              criteria and wants to organize the rubric order all at once,
              especially when working with outcomes. It can also be used to
              allow the user to get the data from one rubric to use as a
              starting template for a new rubric and/or to 'make a copy'.

              This feature loads in a series of custom reports on the course
              sections page. This will help with pulling data about the section
              for review. The data can be viewed in the results table for each
              report and/or downloaded to CSV so the user can manipulate/use the
              data further in another application/script.
