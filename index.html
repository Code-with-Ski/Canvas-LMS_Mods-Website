        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
          The Canvas LMS Mods browser extension modifies the Canvas LMS
          interface to improve the user experience visually and functionally.
          Administrators and teachers are the target audience for this browser
          extension and new features are primarly based on their needs.
          Nonetheless, some of the features also improve the experience for
          students.
        </p>
        <p>
          This browser extension gets additional information to show to the user
          from data that is in the web page source code (but not shown on
          screen) and from Canvas LMS API calls (as needed). It also adds some
          features that are inspired by Ideas from the Canvas Community. For
          example, it adds search, filter, and sort options on "All Courses".
          Features may become deprecated and/or need updates as new features and
          UI updates are released by Instructure for Canvas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users are able to control which features they want to use through the
          options. This allows users to disable features they don't want to use
          and/or that may conflict with other settings/customizations in their
          instance of Canvas LMS.
