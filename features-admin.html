              This feature allows the user to drag and drop rubric rows when a
              rubric is in an editing state. If you drag a row up from its
              current position, it will push the row it is dropped on down. If
              you drag a row down from its current position, it will push the
              row it is dropped on up.

          <div>
            <p>
              This feature allows a user to import the rubric details when
              adding/editing a rubric. The user will need to follow the proper
              format and can use the sample file as a reference point. They will
              need to enter/paste the data in the import dialog with the column
              values separated by a tab. When the data is formatted properly it
              will load the details into the edit rubric preview. This allows
              the user to review the imported data and how it was added to the
              rubric before creating the rubric. This also allows the user to
              add additional criteria and/or import outcomes.
            </p>

            <p>There are two import options:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Import: This will keep any exisiting criteria in the rubric and
                add new rows to the end for the new criteria that are imported.
              </li>
              <li>
                Import and Replace: This will remove any existing criteria from
                the rubric and add rows for the new criteria that are imported.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This feature also adds an export criteria button next to the
              "Import Details" button. This will allow the user to export the
              current criteria in the edit view to a tab separated values file
              that is in the proper format for importing data. This is useful if
              a user has a rubric started already and is looking to add more
              criteria and wants to organize the rubric order all at once,
              especially when working with outcomes. It can also be used to
              allow the user to get the data from one rubric to use as a
              starting template for a new rubric and/or to 'make a copy'.
