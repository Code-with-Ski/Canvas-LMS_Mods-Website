        <h3 id="global">Global Mods</h3>

        <p>
          The following features are mods that apply throughout most/all areas
          of Canvas.
        </p>

        <details>
          <summary>Set body to full-width</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature makes the body of the page full width by default.
              This helps to take advantage of the extra space that is available,
              especially when using wider monitors.
            </p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Enable detailed logging</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature allows for more detailed logs in the console. This
              additional information can help with debugging features that
              aren't working as expected. It is currently focused on the API
              calls/responses.
            </p>

              navigation menu.

        </p>

        <details>
          <summary>Add "See All Courses" button</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature adds a link to the "All Courses" page for a user to
              the dashboard. It is added in the dashboard header actions div.
            </p>

            Show current grade on course cards for student enrollments
          </summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature overlays the user's course grade information on each
              course card where they are a student. This is to provide a similar
              feature to what user's see when viewing courses in the Canvas
              mobile app. It will show a lock on courses where the current
              course grade information is hidden from students. It will show
              'N/A' when a current course grade is not yet available for the
              student.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Uses the Canvas LMS REST API to provide this feature.</em>

              class="screenshot"
