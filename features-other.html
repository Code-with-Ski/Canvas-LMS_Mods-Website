        <p>
          The following features are mods that apply throughout most/all areas
          of Canvas.
        </p>

        <details>
          <summary>Set body to full-width</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature makes the body of the page full width by default.
              This helps to take advantage of the extra space that is available,
              especially when using wider monitors.
            </p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Enable detailed logging</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature allows for more detailed logs in the console. This
              additional information can help with debugging features that
              aren't working as expected. It is currently focused on the API
              calls/responses.
            </p>

            </p>

              navigation menu.
            </p>
            <img
              class="screenshot"

        </p>

        <details>
          <summary>Add "See All Courses" button</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature adds a link to the "All Courses" page for a user to
              the dashboard. It is added in the dashboard header actions div.
            </p>

          </summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This feature overlays the user's course grade information on each
              course card where they are a student. This is to provide a similar
              feature to what user's see when viewing courses in the Canvas
              mobile app. It will show a lock on courses where the current
              course grade information is hidden from students. It will show
              'N/A' when a current course grade is not yet available for the
              student.
            </p>

          <div>
            <p>
              This feature adds the ability to filter the courses on the All
              Courses page. It currently includes filters for the favorite,
              term, enrolled as, and published columns. The filters will be
              disabled if there isn't more than one option.
            </p>

            <p>
              This feature adds the ability to search the courses on the All
              Courses page. It adds search bars to the course and nickname
              columns. The search field will be disabled when there aren't
              values to search.
            </p>
            <img

              Courses page. The sort button is disabled for columns where
              sorting wouldn't affect it (only one row or no values).
            </p>
            <img
              class="screenshot"
              alt="All courses list with arrows pointing to the column headers that were updated."

        <details>
          <summary>Enable All Courses simple search</summary>
          <div>
            <p>
              This adds a simple search functionality to the All Courses list.
              The button to activate it is found in the upper-right. The search
              will look for case insensitve matches to the given search value.
              The search results will highlight the matching search term/phrase.
            </p>
            <p>
              The All Courses simple search includes an option to look at
              current, past, and/or future enrollments based on the All Courses
              list(s). To narrow the courses that are searched further, the
              column search/filter options can be used to only show certain
              courses. The All Courses simple search will only search courses
              that are still shown.
            </p>
            <p>
              It currently supports searching the following content areas (if

              (title and body), discussion topics (title and body), announcement
              topics (title and body), file names, and module item names. The
              Canvas API is used to get the selected items and checck if the
              search value appears within them. Only data that the user has
              permission to view will show in the results.
